Projects during studies at Grit:lab

Disclaimer: these are educational projects made while learning coding from scratch and do not represent my actual current coding style. They have many areas of improvement and lack many good practices and standards. However they also contain some nice solutions and demonstrate in general what kind of coding I have been evolving from.
